A & PTR Record  -> identify Hosting
SOA Record 	-> identify backend original server
TXT Record 	-> check if target domain is using mail spamming protection

In TXT record look for 
1. SPF (Sender policy framework)
2. DKF (Domain Key Identified Mail)
3. DMARC (Domain based Message Auth, Reporting and Conformance)

First check MX record, if present, check TXT record

cat targets.txt | xargs -I@ -P100 bash -c "host -t mx @ "
